# GUI of Finance Risk Management Application
Final project of a NYU course "Finance Software Project"

##Client Side
Use Node.js Express MVC framework to build the GUI of this application.

Client side function:

1. aggregate risk by ticker or quality
2. risk by maturity
3. historical profit & lost chart

Use front-end library: bootstrap, chart.js

##Server Side (Achieved the <strong>fastest speed</strong> in class.)
Server side built by C++ can calculate bond price, dv01, credit risk, VaR(value at risk) and PnL(profit and lost). 


Result data is transferred to client side in JSON format.
